- start with research on how to deploy and compared the big cloud providers
- it was hard to understand the billig thats why i decided to use the free tier of google because it was the easiest to understand with 300$ free credit
- now I did some reasearch on the different ways how to deploy an app on google cloud i found the follwojg options:
  - **google app engine** - this is the easiest way to deploy an app on google cloud but it is not possible to use docker containers
  - **google kubernetes engine** - this is the most complex way to deploy an app on google cloud but it is possible to use docker containers
  - **google Compute Engine** - this is the most flexible way to deploy an app on google cloud but it is the most complex way to deploy an app on google cloud
  - g**oogle cloud run** - this is the easiest way to deploy an app on google cloud with docker containers
- there are also other ways to deploy an app on google cloud but these are the ones I considered
- for mongodb i want to use mongodb atlas because it is the easiest way to deploy a mongodb database
- for this whole project i want to use terraform

- i feel like compute engine is the easiest way to deploy an app on google cloud because i can install everything there but getting HTTPS is more difficult
- but i want to learn more that why i Will try the following:
- i will deploy the backend using cloud run
- i will deploy the frontend using static hosting with firebase hosting
- i will deploy the database using mongodb atlas

- i will start with the backend:
- i will create a docker container for the backend
- I use node slim to reduce the size of the container
- first container 360mb biog now 162mb big
- dockerignore is also used to reduce the size of the container
- i need to adjust some typescritp stuff like the tsconfig.json and the package.json -> write tot dist and build script
- -> container 200mb big -> use prune to reduce the size of the container
